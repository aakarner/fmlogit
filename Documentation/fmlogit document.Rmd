This document provides documentations for the fmlogit package in R. If you have any questions, please contact the author at xji@vt.edu. Any questions, concerns or bug reports are generously welcomed. 

# Overview



```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
