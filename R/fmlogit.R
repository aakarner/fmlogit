#' Estimation of Fractional Multinomial Logit Models
#' 
#' fmlogit allows you to estimate fractional multinomial logit models with Quasi-MLE. It also provides
#' method for calculating marginal and discrete effects, predictions, and aggregate willingness-to-pay
#' calculations. 
#' 
#' The main function to call is \code{fmlogit}, which will estimate the model. Using \code{effects} to
#' estimate marginal or discrete effects will also be very helpful.
